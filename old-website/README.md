Nice to meet you! My name is Eric Chen. I am a student interested in using mathematical and computational tools to inspire expression.  

## About This Blog:
Undefined Behavior is a blog for sharing creative ideas with mathematical or computational origins. I will write about a wide range of topics in the hopes of bringing transparency, approachability, and relatability to deep concepts.
