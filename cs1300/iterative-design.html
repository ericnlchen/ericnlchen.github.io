    <h1>Iterative Design and Evaluation</h1>

        <h3>Choosing a Startup</h3>
        <p>
            Our goal was to identify a startup, then iteratively design and evaluate interfaces to solve their need. We chose Excellence Learning, an AI-driven education startup. Our goal was to create a web interface to help learners browse and enroll in courses, watch lecture videos with a live AI assistant chat, and reinforce concepts through AI-generated quizzes. This report will discuss initial hand-drawn sketches, wireframes, and incorporating critique, culminating in a high-fidelity prototype in Figma (and findings from a usability test). In our design, we aimed to balance clarity, engagement, and consistency for the end users--goals which we believe align with those of Excellence Learning.

        <h3>Sketching & Wireframing</h3>
        <p>
            To get the ideas flowing, we each hand-sketched some low-fidelity interface prototypes of the Excellence Learning app. We each created distinct screens for different parts of the learning platform (plus a few extras).
        </p>
        <p>
            In this sketch, we ideated on a basic homescreen, video screen, and chat-style quiz interface:
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/iterative-design/sketch1.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            This one shares some similarities, but makes the quiz page into a flashcard-style interface (left). It also includes a dedicated page for chatting with the AI tutor (right).
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/iterative-design/sketch2.jpg" width="800px"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            This sketch introduces a course detail page idea (middle), where participants could read about the course before choosing whether to enroll.
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/iterative-design/sketch3.jpg" width="800px"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            Finally, this last sketch explores a gameified progress page (middle) and a dedicated page for taking notes (right).
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/iterative-design/sketch4.jpg" width="800px"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            While all of these ideas could be viable for a final product, we ultimately chose to focus on the three most important screens as we progressed to create a wireframe. We deemed these to be the landing page, quiz page, and lecture page. With this in mind, we used Balsamiq to create the following lo-fi prototype, with notes explaining our design choices on the right of each screen:
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/iterative-design/wireframe.png" width="950px"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            In making this wireframe, some key design choices included:
            <ul>
                <li>Provide easy access to students' enrolled courses and courses of potential interest.</li>
                <li>Use flashcard-style quizzes for approachability and compatability with mobile and tablet screens.</li>
                <li>Allow users watching a lecture to chat with AI live, and use a menu bar on the left to refer back to prior lectures.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Wireframe Critique</h3>
        <p>
            We talked with a TA to receive feedback on our initial wireframe via a critique session. Here were the key points/suggestions they mentioned:
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Landing Page</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve alignment and layout (e.g., "my profile" and course cards should be aligned and centered)</li>
                <li>Make the difference between “new courses” and “my courses” more visually obvious</li>
                <li>Make the navbar smaller, which helps shift the focus to the new courses</li>
                <li>Consider the font/feeling we want to convey</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Quiz Page</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Similar feedback w.r.t. alignment/layout</li>
                <li>Show more metadata (e.g. number of questions remaining)</li>
                <li>Navbar to enable navigating in/out of the page</li>
                <li>Add corner radius to buttons</li>
                <li>Simplify textual instructions for mobile devices ("click to show answer" &RightArrow; "show answer")</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Video Page</b>
            <ul>
                <li>In the chat, include profile pictures and names next to text bubbles</li>
                <li>Left sidebar takes focus away from the lecture, make it less conspicuous</li>
                <li>Include more metadata (e.g. "class 4 out of module XX")</li>
                <li>Maybe have suggestions in the chatbox (e.g. suggest "explain concept_XXX" to the user)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on this feedback, it was time to create a high-fidelity version of our prototype.

        <h3>Hi-Fi Prototype </h3>
        <p>
            Incorporating feedback from TAs, we created a hi-fi prototype in Figma.
