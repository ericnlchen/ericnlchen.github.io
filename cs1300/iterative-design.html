    <h1>Iterative Design and Evaluation</h1>
    <h2>by Eric Chen, Zhongzheng Xu, and Zhicheng Huang</h2>

        <h3>Choosing a Startup</h3>
        <p>
            Our goal was to identify a startup, then iteratively design and evaluate interfaces to solve their need. We chose Excellence Learning, an AI-driven education startup. Our goal was to create a web interface to help learners browse and enroll in courses, watch lecture videos with a live AI assistant chat, and reinforce concepts through AI-generated quizzes. This report will discuss initial hand-drawn sketches, wireframes, and incorporating critique, culminating in a high-fidelity prototype in Figma (and findings from a usability test). In our design, we aimed to balance clarity, engagement, and consistency for the end users&mdash;goals which we believe align with those of Excellence Learning.
        </p>

        <h3>Sketching & Wireframing</h3>
        <p>
            To get the ideas flowing, we each hand-sketched some low-fidelity interface prototypes of the Excellence Learning app. We each created distinct screens for different parts of the learning platform (plus a few extras).
        </p>
        <p>
            In this sketch, we ideated on a basic homescreen, video screen, and chat-style quiz interface:
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/iterative-design/sketch1.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            This one shares some similarities, but makes the quiz page into a flashcard-style interface (left). It also includes a dedicated page for chatting with the AI tutor (right).
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/iterative-design/sketch2.jpg" width="800px"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            This sketch introduces a course detail page idea (middle), where participants could read about the course before choosing whether to enroll.
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/iterative-design/sketch3.jpg" width="800px"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            Finally, this last sketch explores a gameified progress page (middle) and a dedicated page for taking notes (right).
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/iterative-design/sketch4.jpg" width="800px"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            While all of these ideas could be viable for a final product, we ultimately chose to focus on the three most important screens as we progressed to create a wireframe. We deemed these to be the landing page, quiz page, and lecture page. With this in mind, we used Balsamiq to create the following lo-fi prototype, with notes explaining our design choices on the right of each screen:
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/iterative-design/wireframe.png" width="950px"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            In making this wireframe, some key design choices included:
            <ul>
                <li>Provide easy access to students' enrolled courses and courses of potential interest.</li>
                <li>Use flashcard-style quizzes for approachability and compatability with mobile and tablet screens.</li>
                <li>Allow users watching a lecture to chat with AI live, and use a menu bar on the left to refer back to prior lectures.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </section>

        <h3>Wireframe Critique</h3>
        <p>
            We talked with a TA to receive feedback on our initial wireframe via a critique session. Here were the key points/suggestions they mentioned:
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Landing Page</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve alignment and layout (e.g., "my profile" and course cards should be aligned and centered)</li>
                <li>Make the difference between “new courses” and “my courses” more visually obvious</li>
                <li>Make the navbar smaller, which helps shift the focus to the new courses</li>
                <li>Consider the font/feeling we want to convey</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Quiz Page</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Similar feedback w.r.t. alignment/layout</li>
                <li>Show more metadata (e.g. number of questions remaining)</li>
                <li>Navbar to enable navigating in/out of the page</li>
                <li>Add corner radius to buttons</li>
                <li>Simplify textual instructions for mobile devices ("click to show answer" &RightArrow; "show answer")</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Video Page</b>
            <ul>
                <li>In the chat, include profile pictures and names next to text bubbles</li>
                <li>Left sidebar takes focus away from the lecture, make it less conspicuous</li>
                <li>Include more metadata (e.g. "class 4 out of module XX")</li>
                <li>Maybe have suggestions in the chatbox (e.g. suggest "explain concept_XXX" to the user)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            They also suggested adding another screen showing the course's details, as this would likely be necessary information before a student chooses to enroll. Based on this feedback, it was time to create a high-fidelity version of our prototype.
        </p>

        <h3>Hi-Fi Prototype </h3>
        <p>
            Incorporating feedback from TAs, we created a hi-fi prototype in Figma. Our prototype included a <b>Landing Page</b>:
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/iterative-design/Home.png" width="800px"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            <b>Course Details Page</b> (new):
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/iterative-design/Course Detail.png" width="800px"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            <b>Video Page</b>:
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/iterative-design/Lecture.png" width="800px"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            And <b>Quiz Page</b>:
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/iterative-design/Quiz.png" width="800px"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            These updated designs fixed alignment and consistency issues, added more metadata to provide relevant context to the user, enabled navigation in and out of each page, and minimized distractions for students watching lectures. While these designs appeared to have solved a number of the issues from our wireframe, we needed to test them with real users to validate their usability.
        </p>

        <h3>Feedback from Usability Testing </h3>
        <p>
            We came up with the following task for a usability test:
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Imagine you are a high school student struggling in your computer science course.  You want to try AI tutoring to help you learn Python. Please enroll in Intro to Python, check out the lecture, then take the quiz to decide whether you want to use Excellence Learning.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            For this task, we created additional screens making the quiz into an interactive interface with correct and incorrect responses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each of us asked one participant to complete this task, for a total of 3 participants. After the task, we interviewed participants with the following questions (partially inspired by NASA TLX questions):
            <ol>
                <li>How much mental and perceptual activity was required in completing the task? Was it easy or demanding? Simple or complex?</li>
                <li>Were there any subtasks that required especially large mental or perceptual activity? If so, which subtask and why?</li>
                <li>How successful were you in performing the task? How satisfied were you with your performance?</li>
                <li>How irritated, stressed, and annoyed vs. content, relaxed, and complacent did you feel during the task?</li>
                <li>Were there any subtasks where you felt especially irritated, stressed, or annoyed? If so, which subtask and why?</li>
                <li>What is your opinion on the way information is laid out on each page?</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are the results of our usability test. Notes from user 1:
            <ul>
                <li>No major errors on any subtask</li>
                <li>Required prompting to know that they were done with the enrollment task</li>
                <li>Didn't know when they were done at the end of the quiz task</li>
                <li>The above points made the experience less satsifying, but they didn't experience irritation or frustration</li>
            </ul>
            Notes from user 2:
            <ul>
                <li>Easy to use and no points of frustration</li>
                <li>Felt that everything looked clean and workflow felt intuitive</li>
                <li>Once the app gets to the deployment stage, more elements will need to be added for a cohesive experience.</li>
            </ul>
            Notes from user 3:
            <ul>
                <li>No major errors when completing the tasks</li>
                <li>Thought that scrollbar on right of course interface and chat window was scrollable, but it wasn't</li>
                <li>Felt that interface was clear and easy to use.</li>
                <li>Would have liked to have a results page or notification to let them know when the quiz was finished.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            All in all, users confirmed the general usability of the prototype, with some suggestions for improvement. One common theme was a feeling that the prototype was somewhat incomplete in the features it offered. This is expected, since we are only building a few screens out of a potentially very large application, but is still a valid consideration for future work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another theme was that participants wanted additional confirmation once they successfully completed interactions. For example, upon clicking "Enroll Now," it would be good to include a banner saying, "Enrollment was Successful." Similarly, after completing a quiz, there should ideally be a screen indicating completion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another small suggestion from user 1 was to move the "Enroll Now" button below the course description to make it more visually distinct and easier to find.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            In this iterative design process, we created sketches, built lo-fi prototypes, refined them into hi-fi prototypes, and conducted a usability test. Of course, there is always potential to polish and refine the design further, but we hope this provides a solid starting point for Excellence Learning's platform.
