    <h1>Responsive Redesign&mdash;Fishing in Japan</h1>

        <h3>Choosing a Website to Redesign</h3>
        <p>
            I love fishing, but many fishing websites have outdated or inaccessible designs. The website of a local bait & tackle shop, Lucky Bait and Tackle in Warren, RI has a number of usability limitations, and I'd like to try improving it to make it more accessible to all fisherfolk! Check out the original website <a href="http://www.luckybait.com/index.html">here</a>. Here's a screenshot of the home page:

        <h3>Finding Problems</h3>
        <p>
            The first step in the redesign is identifying all of the current problems with the website. Here are some of the major ones I discovered as I tried to use it:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Efficiency Problems:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Inconsistent font sizes and styles makes it slow to identify key information</li>
                <li>Embedding a bunch of YouTube videos in the homepage is distracting and makes me forget what I was doing</li>
                <li>Animated "advertisements" like the "Reel Repair" one aren't clickable, so even if I want to repair my reel it takes me a while to figure out where I should navigate to do that</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Learnability Problems:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    With a variety of images, animations, and text-based links, its hard to know what is actually clickable
                </li>
                <li>
                    Poor use of Gestalt principles for visual grouping (especially the lack of alignment in the leftmost column)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <b>Memorability Problems:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Nonstandard colors of already-clicked links makes it hard to remember where you've already visited</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to these problems, WAVE detected 16 accessibility errors and 42 low contrast errors. 15 of the 16 accessibility issues were for images missing alt text. While many of the low contrast errors were not identifiable to me, the main title with the name of the store did seem low contrast (orange on blue).

        <h3>Visual Design Style Guide</h3>
        <p>
            I created a visual design style guide to standardize the components of my redesign. In creating the style guide, I focused on maintaining as much of the local charm of the original website as possible, while improving upon its many accessibility and usability concerns. See the style guide below, with annotations explaining my decisions in red:
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/redesign/Visual Design Style Guide.png" width="1000px" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px"/>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Mockups</h3>
        <p>
            I created mockups of my redesigned website for three standard screen sizes representing a computer, tablet, and mobile device. Red annotations explain my design choices and how the webiste responsively rearranges content.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the mockup for a computer screen:
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/redesign/Laptop Mockup.png" width="900px"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            Here is the mockup for a tablet screen:
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/redesign/Tablet Mockup.png" width="900px"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            And finally here is the mockup for a mobile device screen:
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src="assets/redesign/Mobile Mockup.png" width="900px"/>
        </div>
        The grey sections are meant to contain clickable advertisements. While the original website had advertisements that could be placed here, they were also in need of a redesign. However, I only focused on the design of the website and left the advertisement redesign for possible future work.

        <h3>Final Redesign</h3>
        <p>
            Using my mockups as a guide, I created a final redesigned website, which you can view and interact with <a href="luckybait.html">here</a>. Finally, here is a static screenshot of the redesigned webpage, which I hope will allow more people to experience the fun of fishing!
