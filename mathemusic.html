                <p>
                    When you listen to music, each note has a certain frequency which governs how "high" or "low" it
                    sounds. As you ascend the piano chromatically (which means to increase one note at a time, including
                    the black notes) you can hear the frequency rising steadily higher.
                </p>
                <div class="audio-holder">
                    <audio controls src="audio/chromatic-piano-climb.wav"></audio>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Based on what you hear you might think that the frequency of the notes is increasing linearly. If we
                    were to plot the frequency of each note on a graph you might expect to see something like this:
                </p>
                <div class="image-holder">
                    <img src="images/piano-graph-linear.png" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    But that would be inaccurate. As it turns out, frequency increases <b>exponentially</b> as you climb
                    chromatically. So the true picture looks something like this:
                </p>
                <div class="image-holder">
                    <img src="images/piano-graph-exponential.png" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    In other words, moving up by one note (which is called moving up a half step) corresponds to
                    <b>multiplying by a constant frequency ratio</b>, rather than adding a constant frequency
                    difference.
                </p>
                <aside>
                    As an aside, frequency ratios form the basis for the theory of harmony. For example, doubling the
                    frequency of a note preserves its "pitch class," leaving it as the same note, only higher.
                    Various other ratios besides the 2:1 ratio for the octave exist which create unique sounds. These
                    are called intervals and they are stacked together to create chords.
                </aside>
                <p>
                    When I realized that my initial intuition about frequency was wrong, I started to wonder what would
                    happen if the relationship between notes
                    and frequency really was linear rather than exponential. What would music sound like?
                    Furthermore, what if we tried using other functions like polynomials or logarithms? In an effort to
                    find out, I wrote some Python code that takes a
                    function as input and re-maps the frequencies of a music file according to the function.

                </div>
                <p>
                    With this tool in hand, I could dream up any function and then listen to how that choice affected a
                    familiar piece of music. The first thing I experimented with was a linear function. Here is what
                    chromatically ascending on a piano would sound like with a linear frequency function.
